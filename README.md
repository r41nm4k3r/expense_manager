# The expense_manager

A new Flutter project.

Features coming soon:


1. Add Search and Filtering Options

Allow users to search for specific transactions or filter them by categories, date, or type (income/expense).

    Search Bar: Add a TextField above the transaction list for searching transactions by keywords (e.g., category or type).
    Filter Options: Include buttons or dropdowns for filtering by date range, category, or type.

2. Add Sorting Functionality

Allow sorting transactions by date, amount, or category.

    Include a dropdown or button to toggle sorting criteria.
    Example criteria: Newest to Oldest, Highest to Lowest Amount, or Alphabetical by Category.

3. Add Pagination or Lazy Loading

For large lists of transactions, implement lazy loading or pagination to improve performance.

    Use ListView.builder with ScrollController to detect when the user scrolls to the end.
    Load more transactions dynamically or display transactions in pages.

4. Add Export to CSV/Excel

Enable users to export their transactions to a CSV or Excel file for external use.

    Use the csv or excel package in Flutter.
    Add a button for exporting transactions, converting them to the desired format.

5. Add Transaction Analytics

Include a visual summary of the user's financial data:

    Pie Chart: Show a breakdown of expenses by category.
    Bar Chart: Compare income vs. expenses over time.
    Use packages like charts_flutter or fl_chart.

6. Add Multi-Delete Feature

Allow users to select multiple transactions and delete them in bulk.

    Use checkboxes in each transaction card to enable selection.
    Add a delete button that operates on selected transactions.

- [x] 7. Add Dark Mode Toggle :heavy_check_mark:

Make the app theme dynamic and toggle between light and dark modes.

    Use ThemeMode in your MaterialApp configuration.
    Allow users to toggle themes from a settings menu.

8. Add Confirmation Dialog for Delete Action

Prevent accidental deletion by showing a confirmation dialog when users try to delete a transaction.


9. Add Offline Data Sync

For a more robust app, sync the local SharedPreferences data with a cloud database (e.g., Firebase Firestore).

    Implement periodic syncing or a manual "Sync Now" button.
    Users won't lose data if they switch devices.

10. Enhance Transaction Editing

Improve the EditTransactionScreen with:

    Inline date and category pickers for seamless editing.
    Validation for input fields (e.g., non-empty, valid amount).

11. Add Notifications

Use the flutter_local_notifications package to send reminders for adding transactions or viewing financial summaries.


12. Add User Profiles

Enable multiple user profiles for shared devices:

    Let users log in and maintain separate transaction data.
    Store profiles locally using SharedPreferences or in the cloud using Firebase.
