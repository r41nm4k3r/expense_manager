1. User Authentication (Login/Signup):

    Why: Secure your app and allow users to save their data across multiple devices. You can integrate Firebase Authentication for easy login/signup features.
    What to add: Create login and signup screens, with Firebase authentication support, so users can securely access their data.

2. Cloud Sync with Firebase:

    Why: This will ensure that users' data is synchronized across all devices. It’s a great addition if you plan on expanding the app to multiple platforms (iOS, web).
    What to add: Store transaction data in Firebase Firestore and sync the data automatically across devices.

3. Budget Planner:

    Why: Allow users to set budgets for different categories (like food, entertainment, etc.), and track if they are within budget.
    What to add: A budget management screen where users can set and track their spending limits. Add a visual progress bar or indicator to show how much of the budget has been used.

4. Reports and Analytics: :white_check_mark:

    Why: Give users insights into their spending habits with detailed reports and charts.
    What to add: Add a "Reports" screen where users can view detailed charts or graphs on their spending (e.g., Pie charts showing income vs. expenses over time, monthly spending breakdown, etc.).

5. Recurring Transactions: :white_check_mark:

    Why: Many users have recurring expenses, such as subscriptions, rent, or utilities.
    What to add: Allow users to create recurring transactions that automatically appear in their transaction list on specified dates.

6. Currency Converter: :white_check_mark:

    Why: If you want to support multiple currencies, it would be useful to include a currency converter that fetches live rates from a reliable source.
    What to add: Integrate an API for real-time currency conversion (such as CurrencyLayer or Open Exchange Rates).

7. Customizable Themes & Dark Mode Enhancements:

    Why: Personalize the app for individual users by allowing them to choose from different themes or customize the existing ones.
    What to add: Let users choose from several pre-defined themes or even create their own. You could also allow a system-wide auto-theme switch based on the device's settings.

8. Search & Filter Transactions:

    Why: As the number of transactions grows, it will become harder to find specific ones.
    What to add: Implement a search bar and filters to allow users to quickly search by category, amount, date, or description.

9. Expense Category Customization:

    Why: Users may want to add their own categories for transactions.
    What to add: Add functionality to allow users to create custom categories and choose icons or colors for each one.

10. Multi-Language Support:

    Why: If you’re planning on reaching a global audience, having the app available in multiple languages would be beneficial.
    What to add: Use Flutter's localization support to offer different languages and regions, making the app accessible to non-English speakers.

11. Invoice Generation:

    Why: If your app is for freelancers or small business owners, generating invoices for transactions could be a great feature.
    What to add: Let users generate PDF invoices for any of their transactions, with a breakdown of income, taxes, and payments.

12. Push Notifications for Reminders:

    Why: Remind users about upcoming bills, payment due dates, or budget limits.
    What to add: Set up push notifications to remind users when a transaction is due or if they are close to exceeding their budget.

13. Export Data to Other Formats (Excel/Google Sheets): :white_check_mark:

    Why: CSV is useful, but many users prefer working with data in Excel or Google Sheets.
    What to add: Integrate features that allow users to export their data to Excel or directly sync with Google Sheets for cloud-based data management.

14. Expense Prediction: :white_check_mark:

    Why: Help users predict their future expenses based on historical data.
    What to add: Implement predictive algorithms that analyze past spending trends and provide forecasts for upcoming expenses.
